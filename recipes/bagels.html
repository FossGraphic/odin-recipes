    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade bagels have never been easier. With this "magic" two-ingredient dough, you can have fresh and fluffy bagels, hot out of the oven, in as much time as it takes to make a batch of pancakes. While not as dense as the traditional New York-style, these chewy, golden bagels, garnished with your favorite cream cheese and flavorful toppings, will satisfy any bagel craving.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a surface dusted with self-rising flour, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Continue adding flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 4 pieces, roughly 4 ounces each. Roll each segment into a smooth ball. Use your thumbs to poke a hole in the center of each round, then gently stretch the dough until it becomes a uniform-sized ring.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg in a small bowl to create an egg wash, then brush a light coating on top of the dough. Sprinkle with bagel seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 22 minutes. Increase the oven's temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and continue to bake until golden, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
